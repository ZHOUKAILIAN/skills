# Self-Optimize Skill

Use this skill to improve skills themselves: create new ones, repair existing ones, and refine SKILL.md content so the whole skill set stays clear and maintainable.

## Goal

When user asks to create a new skill or improve an existing one, handle the full lifecycle: understand the need → implement → test → submit PR. This includes tightening vague, outdated, or inconsistent SKILL.md files so the broader skill collection stays coherent.

---

## Skill Writing Standard

**Every skill produced by self-optimize MUST follow these principles:**

### 1. Semantically Clear, No Ambiguity

Every word in a SKILL.md must have a single clear meaning. Avoid vague terms that could be interpreted multiple ways.

- ✅ "Search for major AI model releases (new versions from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta)"
- ❌ "Update model" (update which model? update how? update the AI model itself, or update info about models?)

### 2. Goal-Oriented, Not Step-by-Step

Tell the AI **what** to achieve, not **how** to execute. The AI can figure out commands, file discovery, and execution order on its own.

- ✅ "Complete the daily check-in and fetch sign record to verify"
- ❌ "Run `python3 -m checkin.xiaojuchongdian.src.main run --task xiaoju.checkin --verify-record`"

### 2. Declare Available Tools, Don't Dictate Usage

If the skill has programmatic assets (scripts, CLI tools, APIs), describe **what they do** and **where they are** relative to the skill. Let the AI read the code and decide how to use them.

- ✅ "Entry point: `main.py`. Read the file to understand usage."
- ❌ "Run `python3 -m checkin.xiaojuchongdian.src.main status --task xiaoju.checkin`"

### 3. Portable Paths Only

Never hardcode absolute or repo-root-relative paths. Use paths relative to the skill itself.

- ✅ "Located in the `scripts/` directory of this skill"
- ❌ "Location: `checkin/xiaojuchongdian/skill/get-params/scripts/`"

### 4. Know What AI Can and Cannot Do

**AI can figure out on its own** (don't over-specify):
- How to run a Python/Shell/Node script after reading it
- Which subcommands or flags a CLI supports
- How to parse JSON output
- How to find files in a directory
- Error handling and retry logic

**AI needs to be told** (must specify):
- The goal and success criteria
- What programmatic assets exist and their purpose
- Key constraints (auth requirements, idempotency, user interaction needed)
- Dependencies on other skills (by skill name, not path)

### 5. Reference by Skill Name, Not Path

Skills depend on each other by **name**. OpenClaw resolves names to locations.

- ✅ "Use the `xiaoju-get-params` skill to refresh credentials"
- ❌ "Switch to `checkin/xiaojuchongdian/skill/get-params/SKILL.md`"

### 6. Declare Dependencies in skill.json

External or sub-skill dependencies must be declared in `skill.json` under `sub_skills` (by skill name), so OpenClaw can auto-install them.

## Scenario A: Creating New Skills

### Patterns

1. **Pure Custom** — no existing skill, build from scratch (e.g., `frontier-changelog`)
2. **Reuse External** — use an existing OpenClaw skill as-is
3. **Extend External** — wrap an existing skill with customization

### Workflow

1. **Understand intent first**: Ask 2-3 clarifying questions, then restate the user's idea back to them in your own words. Get explicit confirmation before proceeding.
2. Scaffold the skill directory with `SKILL.md` + `skill.json`
3. Write the SKILL.md following the **Skill Writing Standard** above
4. Implement code if needed (in a `src/` or `scripts/` directory within the skill)
5. Register in `daily/skill/SKILL.md` if it's a scheduled task
6. Test and create PR

---

## Scenario B: Fixing / Improving Existing Skills

### Workflow

1. Identify which skill is affected (by skill name or user description)
2. **Restate the problem back to the user** and confirm understanding before making changes
3. Read the skill's SKILL.md and implementation code to understand current behavior
4. Diagnose the issue
5. Fix code and/or update SKILL.md
5. If the SKILL.md violates the **Skill Writing Standard** above, refactor it as part of the fix
6. Test and create PR

---

## Key Constraints

- **No secrets in code** — API keys/tokens via environment variables only
- **PR required** — all changes go through PR for human review
- **Docs-first for behavior changes** — update `docs/requirements/` or `docs/design/` before changing behavior
- **Simple bug fixes** can skip docs and go straight to code
